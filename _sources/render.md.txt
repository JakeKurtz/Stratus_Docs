## Viewport Editor

```{warning}
If the **Viewport Editor** is enabled and you make any changes to the Stratus menus, the HDRI that was baked will be **overwritten** with the viewport render settings.
```

Messing around with a bunch of parameters, without seeing how it affects your sky, is a miserable way to work. The viewport editor is a powerful feature that allows users to create and edit skies easily and efficiently. Real-time feedback gives you the power to quickly generate a variety of sky backgrounds that meet your needs.

### Getting Started

Navigate to the **Stratus** tab in the 3D viewport. In **Render Settings** under **Viewport**, click **Start Viewport Editor**.

Ensure that **Show Overlays** is enabled.

To stop the **Viewport Editor**, press the **ESC** key.

## Bake

Bakes the HDRI image using the **Render** settings. The HDRI will be saved in Blenders images as **STRATUS_ENV_TEX**

## Render Animation

```{warning}
**Render Animation** will freeze Blender until the job is done.
```

If you want to animate the Stratus HDRI, you **must use** this operator to render your animation. Due to how Stratus was built and how Blender works, you **cannot** use Blender's **Render > Render Animation**. 

The only limitation is that **Blender will be unresponsive** when rendering, and you cannot use video output formats such as **AVI JPEG, AVI Raw, or FFmpeg Video**.

## General Render Settings

### Environment Image Strength

### Environment Texture Size

Determines the **resolution** of the HDRI image. The option will be a multiple of **1024 x 512** pixels. i.e.

    (1024 x 512) * size

### Max Steps

Controls the maximum number of steps, when marching through the cloud layers. The more steps, the prettier the clouds will look, but the longer the render will take.

### Max Light Steps

Controls the maximum number of steps, when marching towards a light source. The more steps, the prettier the clouds will look, but the longer the render will take.

### Use Tiling

Render high resolution images in tiles to reduce memory usage, using the specified tile size.

### Use Bicubic Sampling

```{note}
Requires 8x more samples than bilinear sampling (default). This can double the render time!
```

Bicubic sampling is a way to preserve the fine details when magnifying textures. It does this by using some fancy math to estimate the value of unknown pixels based on a larger area of known pixels. The result is a smoother and more accurate image. This should be used to avoid bicubic sampling artifacts.

```{tip}
Since bicubic sampling is very **expensive**, it's best to avoid unless absolutely needed. Blinear artifacts will generally show up when using the **cirro cloud layer**. 
```

### Pixel Size

Similar to Cycles, you can alter the pixel size for the viewport rendering. This can greatly speed up render times.
